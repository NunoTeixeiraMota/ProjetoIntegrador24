## Burndown Chart

We use a burndown chart to visualize our project's progress over time. This chart helps us track the completion of tasks and identify potential delays. Below is a link to our live burndown chart:

The burndown chart is updated regularly to reflect the latest status of our project.

## Issue Automation with ghscript

We've developed a custom script called "ghscript" to automate the process of creating GitHub issues based on the information provided in the Excel file. This script streamlines the issue creation process and ensures that our project management is efficient and organized!
